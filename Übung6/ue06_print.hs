-- Aufgabe 6
{-
Of course I don't know much about Multitrees, so I got 
some suggestions from https://wiki.haskell.org/99_questions/70B_to_73

 I cant believe that I even try this
 A "Multitree" datatype is pretty similar to our Binary Tree, except it has
 a list of children and not just two, the children themselves can just be a tree again
 Also we don't use a "Nil", because of how we build a tree
 If our tree is: 
 NodeA 'a' [NodeA 'b' []] our Nil would automatically just be the []
 It just is easier than typing:
 NodeA 'a' [NodeA 'b' Nil]

--Since the functions "nodes" and "height" are already defined I name them different

This is the same nodes function as for SimpleBT, but

sum them. (I am allowed to use map and sum, since there are no restrictions on the assignment)

2 in the morning and after 2 whole hours of just reading error messages
I'm actually afraid to touch anything here, but I guess the [(mapTree func y)]
just cycles through every possible child there is recusivly.

not find it
